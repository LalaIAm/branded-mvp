# Brand Builder

## Executive Summary

This project is a comprehensive Brand Builder application designed to guide users through the phases of brand development, from audience research and brand strategy foundation to brand identity creation and positioning. It leverages modern technologies including Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, AI APIs (OpenAI, DALL-E), and PWA capabilities to deliver a scalable, fast, and user-friendly experience. Key features include persona creation, competitor analysis, mission and vision wizards, values and personality setting, logo and palette generation, and exportable polished documents such as strategy briefs and style guides. After project completion, users are presented with a clear summary dashboard highlighting key brand assets and documents, with options to duplicate, archive, or start new projects, alongside suggested next steps to revisit phases or explore future collaboration features. Optional notifications, including email and in-app alerts for progress reminders and phase completions, are planned to enhance user engagement and keep users on track without being intrusive. The project aims to provide a robust brand planning assistant with phased rollout and future integrations like Google Docs and Figma syncing to support continuous growth and collaboration.
