# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement AI Logo Generator API
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create an API that uses the DALL-E 3 API to generate logo concepts based on user inputs such as style (e.g., wordmark, abstract), brand name, and descriptive keywords.
# Details:
Implement a `POST /api/projects/:id/logo-generator` endpoint. The backend service will construct a detailed prompt for the DALL-E 3 API from the user's inputs. The generated images should be uploaded to a cloud storage service (like Firebase Storage), and the public URLs of these images will be saved into the project document in MongoDB.

# Test Strategy:
Write an integration test for the endpoint that mocks both the DALL-E 3 API call and the cloud storage upload. The test should verify that a URL is correctly saved to the project's data.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design API Endpoint and Prompt Construction [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the POST /api/projects/:id/logo-generator endpoint and implement logic to construct a detailed prompt for DALL-E 3 based on user inputs (style, brand name, keywords).
### Details:
Specify the request and response schema for the endpoint. Develop a function that takes user inputs and generates a prompt optimized for logo creation with DALL-E 3. Ensure prompt flexibility for different logo styles (e.g., wordmark, abstract).

## 2. Integrate DALL-E 3 API and Cloud Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Implement backend service to call the DALL-E 3 API with the constructed prompt, handle the image response, and upload the generated image to cloud storage (e.g., Firebase Storage).
### Details:
Use the OpenAI API key securely to access DALL-E 3. Parse the API response to obtain the image URL or binary data. Upload the image to the chosen cloud storage and retrieve the public URL for later use.

## 3. Save Image URLs and Write Integration Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Save the public image URLs to the project document in MongoDB and implement integration tests that mock the DALL-E 3 API and cloud storage upload.
### Details:
Update the project document with the new logo image URLs. Write integration tests to verify that the endpoint correctly saves the URL, mocking external dependencies for reliable testing.
