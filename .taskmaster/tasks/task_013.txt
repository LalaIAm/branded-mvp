# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement AI Brand Name Generator API
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create an API that generates brand name ideas based on user-provided keywords, industry, and style preferences, using the OpenAI API.
# Details:
Implement a `POST /api/projects/:id/name-generator` endpoint. The request body will include keywords, industry, and filters (e.g., 'style: inventive'). The backend service will use OpenAI GPT-4 to generate a list of potential brand names. Also, implement endpoints to save and remove 'favorited' names within the project document in MongoDB.

# Test Strategy:
Integration test the name generation endpoint, mocking the AI call. Write separate tests for the 'favorite' and 'unfavorite' actions to ensure they correctly update the project data.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design API Endpoints for Brand Name Generation and Favorites Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and document the API endpoints required for the AI brand name generator, including the POST endpoint for generating names and endpoints for saving/removing favorited names within a project.
### Details:
Specify the request and response schemas for each endpoint. Ensure the endpoints align with RESTful conventions and support necessary parameters such as keywords, industry, and style filters.

## 2. Implement AI Brand Name Generation Logic Using OpenAI GPT-4 [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Develop the backend service that processes user input and interacts with the OpenAI GPT-4 API to generate brand name suggestions based on provided keywords, industry, and style preferences.
### Details:
Integrate the OpenAI GPT-4 API, construct effective prompts, handle API responses, and format the generated names for the frontend. Ensure error handling and logging are in place.

## 3. Integrate Favorites Functionality with MongoDB [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Implement the logic to save and remove favorited brand names within the project document in MongoDB, ensuring data consistency and efficient updates.
### Details:
Create or update MongoDB queries to add or remove names from a 'favorites' array in the project document. Ensure endpoints are secure and only accessible to authorized users.
