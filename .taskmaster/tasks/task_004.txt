# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build Frontend Authentication UI and State Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the React components for the landing page, registration form, and login form. Implement global state management to handle user authentication status and persist the session.
# Details:
Build responsive UI components for Signup and Login using React and style them with Tailwind CSS and Heroicons. Use React Router for navigation. Implement a global state solution (e.g., React Context API with hooks) to manage authentication state (user data, token). On successful login/registration, store the JWT in `localStorage` and update the global context. Implement a logout feature that clears the token and state.

# Test Strategy:
Use React Testing Library to unit test form components, including input handling and validation feedback. Mock API calls with a library like `msw` or `jest.mock` to test UI behavior on success and error states. Use Cypress for end-to-end testing of the complete signup, login, and logout user flows.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Authentication UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create responsive React components for the landing page, registration (signup) form, and login form. Style these components using Tailwind CSS and Heroicons. Ensure forms handle user input, display validation errors, and provide feedback for both success and error states.
### Details:
Implement input fields for email and password, validation logic (e.g., using zod or similar), and error display. Use React Router to navigate between landing, signup, and login pages. Ensure accessibility and responsive design.

## 2. Implement Global Authentication State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Set up a global state management solution using React Context API and hooks to manage authentication status, user data, and JWT token. Ensure the authentication state is accessible throughout the app and persists sessions using localStorage.
### Details:
Create an AuthContext and Provider to wrap the app. Implement functions for sign up, sign in, and sign out within the context. On successful authentication, store the JWT in localStorage and update the context. Provide a logout function that clears the token and resets state.

## 3. Test Authentication UI and State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Write unit and end-to-end tests for the authentication UI and state management. Use React Testing Library for component and form validation tests, and Cypress for full user flow (signup, login, logout). Mock API calls to test UI behavior on success and error.
### Details:
Test input handling, validation feedback, and state updates. Ensure that authentication state persists across reloads and that logout clears all relevant data. Verify navigation and protected route access based on authentication state.
