# Task ID: 1
# Title: Initialize Project and Configure Development Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the project repository for the Brand Builder application, including frontend (React) and backend (Node.js). Configure essential tooling like ESLint, Prettier, Docker, and environment variables to ensure a consistent and efficient development workflow.
# Details:
Initialize a Git repository. Create a standard folder structure for a monorepo or separate repos. In the backend, set up a Node.js server with Express. In the frontend, initialize a React application using Create React App or Vite. Add ESLint and Prettier configurations to enforce code style. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to orchestrate Node.js, MongoDB, and Redis containers for local development. Define environment variable handling using `.env` files.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that `npm run dev` (or equivalent) starts both frontend and backend services. Confirm that linting and formatting scripts run correctly on pre-commit hooks (if using Husky). Ensure Docker containers build and run without errors.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Git Repository Initialization and Folder Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize a new Git repository and establish a clear folder structure for both frontend and backend components, supporting a monorepo or separate repositories as needed.
### Details:
Run `git init` in the project root. Create directories such as `/backend` for Node.js/Express and `/frontend` for React. Add a `.gitignore` file to exclude node_modules, build artifacts, and environment files.

## 2. Backend (Node.js/Express) Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up the backend using Node.js and Express, including initial configuration, entry point, and basic routing.
### Details:
Navigate to `/backend`, run `npm init -y`, and install Express. Create `server.js` or `app.js` as the entry point. Set up a basic Express server and define a sample route. Organize code into folders like `/routes`, `/controllers`, and `/config` for scalability.

## 3. Frontend (React) Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Initialize the frontend using React, setting up the development environment and folder structure.
### Details:
Navigate to `/frontend` and run `npx create-react-app .` or use Vite for a faster setup. Ensure the folder structure supports components, pages, and assets. Verify the app runs with `npm start`.

## 4. ESLint and Prettier Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Configure ESLint and Prettier for both frontend and backend to enforce consistent code style and formatting.
### Details:
Install ESLint and Prettier in both `/backend` and `/frontend`. Initialize ESLint with `npx eslint --init` and create `.eslintrc` and `.prettierrc` files. Add lint and format scripts to `package.json`.

## 5. Docker and docker-compose Setup for Node.js, MongoDB, and Redis [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Create Dockerfiles and a docker-compose configuration to orchestrate Node.js backend, MongoDB, and Redis containers for local development.
### Details:
Write a `Dockerfile` for the backend. Create a `docker-compose.yml` in the project root to define services for Node.js, MongoDB, and Redis. Configure volumes and environment variables for each service.

## 6. Environment Variable Management with .env Files [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3, 1.5
### Description: Set up environment variable management using `.env` files for both backend and frontend, ensuring sensitive data is not committed to version control.
### Details:
Create `.env` files in `/backend` and `/frontend` for storing environment-specific variables. Use libraries like `dotenv` in Node.js to load variables. Add `.env` to `.gitignore`.

## 7. Pre-commit Hooks (e.g., Husky) for Linting/Formatting [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Configure pre-commit hooks using Husky to automatically run linting and formatting scripts before commits.
### Details:
Install Husky in the project root. Set up hooks to run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` on staged files before each commit. Verify hooks are triggered during the commit process.
