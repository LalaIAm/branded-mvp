# Task ID: 9
# Title: Build Persona Creation UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the user interface for the persona creation tool, including input forms for audience data and a visually appealing display for the AI-generated persona cards.
# Details:
Create a React component with a form for users to input audience characteristics. On submission, call the `POST /api/projects/:id/persona` endpoint and display a loading state. Once the data is returned, render the personas as distinct, well-designed cards using Tailwind CSS. Each card should clearly present the persona's name, photo (can be a stock icon initially), demographics, and psychographics.

# Test Strategy:
Use React Testing Library to test the form and the rendering of persona cards from mock data. Use Cypress to test the full user flow: filling out the form, submitting, seeing a loading state, and then viewing the generated persona card.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Persona Creation Form UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a React component with a form for users to input audience characteristics such as demographics, goals, and pain points. Ensure the form is user-friendly and visually appealing using Tailwind CSS.
### Details:
The form should include fields for persona name, photo (stock icon), demographics, psychographics, and other relevant audience data. Use clear labels and validation feedback to guide users.

## 2. Integrate API and Loading State [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement logic to submit the form data to the `POST /api/projects/:id/persona` endpoint and display a loading state while awaiting the AI-generated persona data.
### Details:
On form submission, disable the form and show a loading spinner or message. Handle API responses and errors gracefully, providing feedback to the user.

## 3. Render AI-Generated Persona Cards [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Display the returned persona data as distinct, well-designed cards. Each card should clearly present the persona's name, photo, demographics, and psychographics using Tailwind CSS.
### Details:
Ensure each card is visually distinct and memorable, using bold color schemes and clear layout. Include all relevant persona details and make the cards easy to scan and understand.
