# Task ID: 14
# Title: Build Brand Name Generator UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the UI for the brand name generator, including input fields for criteria, filters, and a dynamic display for the generated names with a 'favorite' feature.
# Details:
Create a React component with a form for keywords and filters. On form submission, call the name generator API and display the returned list of names. Each name in the list should have a clickable star or heart icon to mark it as a favorite. This action should trigger an API call to update the project's list of favorited names.

# Test Strategy:
Test the form submission and the rendering of the name list using mock data. Test the 'favorite' button's click handler to ensure it calls the correct API and updates the UI state accordingly (e.g., a filled vs. an empty star).

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Brand Name Generator Form UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the user interface for the brand name generator form, including input fields for keywords and filters that guide the name generation process.
### Details:
Design and implement a React component with clearly labeled input fields for users to enter brand-related keywords and select relevant filters (such as industry, style, or length). Ensure the form is accessible and visually consistent with the application's design system.

## 2. Implement Dynamic Name List Display with Favorite Feature [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Develop the UI component that displays the generated brand names and allows users to mark names as favorites.
### Details:
After form submission, display the list of generated names in a dynamic, scrollable area. Each name should have a clickable star or heart icon to mark it as a favorite. Clicking the icon should trigger an API call to update the favorite status and visually reflect the change (e.g., filled vs. empty icon).

## 3. Integrate API Calls and State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Connect the UI components to the backend API for generating names and updating favorites, and manage UI state accordingly.
### Details:
Implement logic to call the name generator API on form submission and update the UI with the returned names. Ensure the favorite action triggers the appropriate API call and updates the UI state in real time. Handle loading, error, and empty states for a smooth user experience.
