# Task ID: 25
# Title: Set Up CI/CD Pipeline for Production Deployment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure a full CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automatically test, build, and deploy the frontend and backend applications to a production hosting environment.
# Details:
Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file. The workflow should be triggered on pushes to the `main` branch. Define separate jobs for the backend and frontend. Each job should: 1) Check out the code, 2) Set up the correct environment (e.g., Node.js), 3) Install dependencies, 4) Run all tests (linting, unit, integration). If tests pass, a final 'deploy' job will run, building the production assets and deploying them to the chosen hosting providers (e.g., Firebase, Vercel, Heroku). Use GitHub Secrets to store all necessary API keys and credentials.

# Test Strategy:
Create a test deployment to a staging environment first. Manually trigger the workflow and monitor its execution in the GitHub Actions tab. Verify that a successful push to the designated branch results in a live deployment. Check the application logs on the hosting provider for any runtime errors.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Workflow Triggers and Jobs in deploy.yml [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the .github/workflows/deploy.yml file. Specify workflow triggers (e.g., push to main branch) and define separate jobs for backend and frontend processes.
### Details:
Configure the workflow to trigger on events such as push to the main branch, pull requests, and manual dispatch. Define at least two jobs: one for backend and one for frontend, ensuring they run in parallel or sequentially as needed.

## 2. Implement Backend CI/CD Steps [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Set up the backend job to perform code checkout, environment setup, dependency installation, testing, building, and deployment.
### Details:
In the backend job, add steps to check out the code, set up Node.js, install dependencies, run linting and tests, build the backend, and deploy to the production hosting provider if all previous steps succeed.

## 3. Implement Frontend CI/CD Steps [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Set up the frontend job to perform code checkout, environment setup, dependency installation, testing, building, and deployment.
### Details:
In the frontend job, add steps to check out the code, set up Node.js, install dependencies, run linting and tests, build the frontend assets, and deploy to the production hosting provider if all previous steps succeed.

## 4. Configure Environment Variables and Secrets [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Set up required environment variables and secrets for both backend and frontend jobs using GitHub Actions' secrets and environment features.
### Details:
Define secrets in the repository or environment settings (e.g., API keys, deployment tokens). Reference these secrets in the workflow jobs to securely inject them during build and deployment steps.

## 5. Staging Deployment and Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.2, 25.3, 25.4
### Description: Configure a staging environment in the workflow and deploy both backend and frontend to staging for verification before production deployment.
### Details:
Add a job or environment for staging deployment. Ensure that deployments to staging can be manually or automatically triggered, and include steps to verify the deployment (e.g., smoke tests, manual checks).

## 6. Production Deployment and Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.5
### Description: Set up production deployment steps and integrate monitoring or post-deployment checks to ensure application health.
### Details:
Configure the workflow to deploy to production only after successful staging verification. Integrate monitoring steps, such as health checks or notifications, to confirm the deployment succeeded and the application is running as expected.
