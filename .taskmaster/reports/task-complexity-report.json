      "taskTitle": "Initialize Project and Configure Development Environment",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the environment setup into: (1) Git repository initialization and folder structure, (2) Backend (Node.js/Express) setup, (3) Frontend (React) setup, (4) ESLint and Prettier configuration, (5) Docker and docker-compose setup for Node.js, MongoDB, and Redis, (6) Environment variable management with .env files, (7) Pre-commit hooks (e.g., Husky) for linting/formatting.",
      "reasoning": "This task covers multiple foundational activities across both backend and frontend, as well as tooling and containerization. Each area (repo, backend, frontend, linting, Docker, env management, hooks) is a distinct concern, and best practices recommend modularizing these for clarity and maintainability. The complexity is moderate due to the breadth of technologies and the need for integration, but each subtask is well-understood in modern development workflows."

      "taskTitle": "Implement User Registration and Login API",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) User schema/model definition, (2) Registration endpoint with validation and password hashing, (3) Login endpoint with credential validation and JWT issuance, (4) Error handling for registration/login, (5) Integration with MongoDB, (6) Automated tests for all scenarios.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves secure authentication, data validation, error handling, and integration with a database and JWT. Each step is critical for security and reliability, and industry standards require thorough testing and separation of concerns. The complexity is above average due to security considerations and the need for robust error handling and test coverage."

      "taskTitle": "Create API for Project CRUD Operations",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) Project schema/model definition, (2) Create project endpoint, (3) Read/list projects endpoint, (4) Update project endpoint, (5) Delete project endpoint, (6) Access control and scoping to authenticated user.",
      "reasoning": "CRUD APIs are standard but require careful design for data integrity and security. Associating projects with users and enforcing access control adds complexity. Each endpoint and the access logic should be implemented and tested separately for maintainability and security."

      "reasoning": "The dashboard involves UI composition, API integration, and user interaction patterns. Each UI and data-fetching concern should be modularized. While not algorithmically complex, the task requires attention to UX and state management, making it moderately complex."

      "reasoning": "This is primarily a UI aggregation task, requiring data fetching and presentation. The complexity is moderate due to the need to coordinate multiple data sources and ensure a cohesive, user-friendly summary view."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Archive endpoint implementation, (2) Duplicate endpoint implementation, (3) Frontend controls for archive/duplicate, (4) UI updates to reflect archived/duplicated projects, (5) Integration and testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves both backend logic (state changes, deep copy) and frontend UI/UX updates. Duplication requires careful handling to avoid data integrity issues. Each operation and its UI should be handled as a separate subtask."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) Versions collection/schema setup, (2) Autosave endpoint implementation, (3) Logic for updating main project and saving snapshots, (4) Frontend autosave trigger integration, (5) Database queries for verification, (6) Automated tests for versioning.",
      "reasoning": "Versioning and autosave introduce complexity in data modeling, atomic operations, and integration with the frontend. Ensuring consistency and performance, as well as providing a reliable revision history, requires careful design and testing."

      "reasoning": "A notification system spans schema changes, backend services, scheduling, and integration with external systems (email). Each aspect (preferences, in-app, email, scheduling, API) is a distinct concern and should be modularized for maintainability and testability."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Create manifest.json, (2) Service worker setup (Workbox), (3) Register service worker in React entry point, (4) Test installability and offline support.",
      "reasoning": "PWA setup is well-documented and supported by tooling, making it relatively straightforward. The main complexity is ensuring correct configuration and testing across browsers, but the steps are clear and modular."

      "reasoning": "Modern CI/CD pipelines involve multiple jobs, environment management, and integration with hosting providers. Each job (backend/frontend), environment setup, and deployment step should be isolated for clarity and maintainability. Testing and monitoring are critical for reliability."
